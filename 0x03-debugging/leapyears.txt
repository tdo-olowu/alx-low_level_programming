LEAP YEARS
I admit this problem is irritating to think about.
So, a leap year is either a year that is divisible by 4 but not 100 (e.g. 1988),
or it is divisible by both 100 and 400 e.g. 1600, 2000, 2400.
But why?
It's hardly explained, it just seems like an arbitrary rule.

Given a date, how do we calculate the number of remaining days in this year?

-	Convert the date to the nth day of the year. n begins at 1.
		Be sensitive to leap years.

-	Leap year or not, let's call L the total number of days in the given year.
	How many days are found in the set n < k <= L? There are exactly (L - n) days.

-	If it's a leap year, L == 366. Otherwise, L == 365.
