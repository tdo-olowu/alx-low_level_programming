WHAT SHOULD A HEADER CONTAIN?
-	A header guard
-	Function declarations
-	Macro definitions
-	Useful general-purpose constants
-	System-wide global variables

WHAT'S THE SYNTAX FOR INCLUDING HEADERS
For system files use
	#include <file>
For home-made header files use
	#include "file"
The latter will search the current working directory for the file. When compiling, check what the -i flag does. It's for directory control read the manual.


HEADER GUARDS
Why should we care? Because it prevents the preprocessor from copy-pasting the header multiple times.
If that happens, we will suffer a compile error.
Use a conditional inclusion...

	#ifndef HEADER_FILE
	#define HEADER_FILE

	/* insert file contents here */

	#endif

It *almost* looks like BASH syntax (although BASH is if...fi)

WHAT IS A MAKEFILE?
I keep seeing this but haven't had the time to learn about it.
