Requirements:
no global variables
at most five functions per file
no standard library? Huh? No printf, puts, etc.
Seems _putchar is allowed. What is that?
Oh ok. It seems that they have their own putchar.
If I'm understanding clearly, you should write your own 'main.h' header file with the prototypes of all your functions, and prototype of _putchar.
You will then #include this main in each other file or something.
Hmm...I think you should write just the functions. They allegedly have their own main.c which will test your function.
A bit confusing but OK.
